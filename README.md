## Why you built this project / what does it solve?
The rise of ridesharing has caused serious problem related to the rise in assault crimes (i.e. attack, fights and sex violence). 

This project is aiming the safety provisioning for passenger during carsharing by using live video broadcasting (agora.io), which tie to the on-demand "insurance per ride" via smar contract.
 
The inward camera can detect any violent assaults inside the car, in which alarm will be trigger to alert the police actions, while the front camera ensures safe route to destination and identify any drunk driving behaviours by the driver, where action can be taken to ban the driver in the future. 

The video live-data will be analysed via AI and archieved in blockchain for future big data analytics and served as vital evdivence should any incidents happen. While providing the safety features, our solution also mutually addressing the needs of the current and future markets within car-sharing economy and on-demand insurance.
